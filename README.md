# data-visualization-threw-seaborn-and-matplotlib-library
This project focuses on creating visualizations for the famous Iris dataset using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. The repository includes code that tackles a variety of tasks aimed at helping visualize different aspects of the Iris dataset.

Key Visualizations:
General Static Plot:

Use of Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent the Iris dataset visually.
Pie Chart for Species Frequency:

A pie chart showing the distribution of the three species of flowers in the dataset.
Scatter Plot for Sepal Length vs Sepal Width:

A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between sepal length and sepal width, colored by species.
Pairplot for all Features:

A pairplot showing pairwise relationships in the dataset, including comparisons of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each species.
Joint Plot for Sepal Dimensions:

A joint plot to visualize the correlation between sepal length and sepal width with a scatter plot representation.
Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) Plot:

KDE plots for the Setosa species, visualizing the density distribution of sepal length vs sepal width and petal length vs petal width.
